# Genetical-Algorithm-Project-Python
Problem Context:
  Concrete strength is a critical factor in civil engineering, as it directly affects the safety, durability, and economic feasibility of structures. Accurately determining this strength typically requires time-consuming and costly laboratory tests. In this context, predicting the compressive strength of concrete based on its composition becomes a highly relevant problem, as it enables the optimization of material usage, cost reduction, and increased efficiency in civil construction processes.
Objective:
  This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete using Computational Intelligence techniques, with an emphasis on Evolutionary Computation. By applying genetic algorithms, the goal is not only to accurately estimate the final strength based on the concrete’s chemical composition, but also to automatically identify the optimal combination of materials that maximizes this performance.

Justification:
  The choice of Evolutionary Computation—specifically Genetic Algorithms—is justified by their effectiveness in solving complex optimization problems, such as concrete formulation. Unlike traditional approaches that only predict an output value, genetic algorithms are capable of exploring large search spaces and discovering optimal solutions, even when multiple variables interact in a non-linear manner. By using this type of technique, it becomes possible not only to model compressive strength based on historical data (through regression), but also to generate new and optimized solutions to the problem, contributing to significant advancements in the automation of construction processes.

  The dataset used in this work is the "Concrete Compressive Strength" dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
